// E-13: Supabase AuthErrors used to be surfaced by rendering `e.message`
// straight into the view. That leaks SDK/GoTrue prose ("Invalid login
// credentials", "For security purposes, you can only request this after 46
// seconds") in a voice that is not ours, and it made the login view sniff for
// the substring /not confirmed/i to decide whether to offer a resend.
//
// auth-js 2.112.3 puts a stable machine-readable `code` on every AuthError
// (type ErrorCode in node_modules/@supabase/auth-js/dist/module/lib/
// error-codes.d.ts), so key on that first, `status` second, and never on prose.
//
// Deliberately NOT routed through lib/errors.js friendlyError(): AuthErrors
// carry an HTTP status, so friendlyError would collapse every one of these into
// its generic status copy (constraint from commit 1d0f4aa).

// Same sentences as the corresponding branches in lib/errors.js, so an auth
// failure and an API failure of the same kind read identically. Kept as
// literals because errors.js does not export them.
