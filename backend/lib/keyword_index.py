"""Per-session keyword index for retrieval arbitration (Spec §3.1, §4.1).

Lowercase -> token boundary on non-alphanumerics -> drop pure-digit tokens,
stopwords, and tokens shorter than 2 -> Snowball/Porter stem. Stored as a
JSON-encoded list on Session.kw_index_json.

The index is populated at ingestion time from each chunk's text and used at
chat time to compute a boolean `retrieval_required` flag for prompt injection.
