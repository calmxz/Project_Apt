"""C-03: reject oversized request bodies before anything tries to parse them.

Without this gate, a client can post an arbitrarily large JSON document and
the framework will buffer the whole thing in memory before the route's
validation ever sees it -- the size check has to happen upstream of parsing
to be worth anything.

Deliberately pure ASGI rather than BaseHTTPMiddleware: BaseHTTPMiddleware
buffers responses, which would break SSE streaming on /chat/stream. Mirrors
lib/request_id.py.

Multipart uploads are exempt by content-type (not by path): they are
legitimately far larger than any JSON body, and routes/upload.py enforces its
own MAX_UPLOAD_BYTES against both the declared Content-Length and the bytes
actually read.
