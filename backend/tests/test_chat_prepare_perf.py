"""P3.1 statement-count budget for the chat prepare path.

Counts SQL statements issued by _prepare_turn via before_cursor_execute.
Budget (spec P3.1): <=6 happy path, <=7 when the gap-accuracy aggregate
runs (non-empty confirmed_gaps). Uses an existing user: the first-turn-ever
user-create path is excluded from the budget by design.
