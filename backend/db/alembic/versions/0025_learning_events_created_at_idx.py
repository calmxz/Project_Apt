"""index on learning_events.created_at (F-07)

Revision ID: 0025_learning_events_created_at_idx
Revises: 0024_sessions_chunk_centroid
Create Date: 2026-09-19

GET /api/review/queue now bounds its scan to the last REVIEW_WINDOW_DAYS
days (services/review_queue_service.py). ix_learning_events_session already
confines that query to the caller's sessions, so the created_at predicate
was a filter over those rows rather than a full-table scan; this index gives
the planner a second access path (range-scan the window, then join) for a
query that runs on each sidebar boot. Which plan wins should be settled with
EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS) on the live DB -- see the PR notes.

Built with CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY: learning_events takes a write on every
graded check answer, and a plain CREATE INDEX holds a SHARE lock that blocks
those writes for the duration. CONCURRENTLY cannot run inside a transaction,
hence the autocommit_block (same shape as 0023_worker_queue).

Idempotency, both retry modes: if_not_exists / if_exists cover "index built
but alembic_version never stamped". A CONCURRENTLY build that fails part-way
leaves an INVALID index of the same name, and IF NOT EXISTS matches on name
only -- it would no-op and stamp the revision, leaving an index the planner
ignores but every INSERT still maintains. So the upgrade drops an invalid
namesake first (migration review, HIGH).
