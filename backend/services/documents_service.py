"""Session-wide document ingestion status (Spec: reference-files design 2026-06-14).

Replaces the per-call-site "latest document" lookups that previously decided
retrieval readiness and `ingestion_status`. Those keyed on the most-recent

These helpers aggregate across all of a session's documents instead.
