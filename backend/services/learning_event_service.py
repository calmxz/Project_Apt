    No turn-barrier applies here: a human click is not the LLM,
    and record_learning_event is no longer a tool, so the ask-and-self-grade
    exploit the barrier guarded against is impossible.

    Applies the deterministic profile effects, because the click is silent and
    the agent's only next-turn signal is the profile state:
    - correct  -> add gap to mastered_concepts (tested mastery) and remove it
      from confirmed_gaps (exclusivity, F-13); a focus pointing at that gap
      is cleared
    - incorrect-> remove gap from mastered_concepts if present (demotion), and add
      gap to confirmed_gaps if not already present (an incorrect retest is
      confirmed-gap evidence, so the demoted concept is a valid review target)

    apply_profile_effects=False (used by the knowledge diagnostic) still writes
    the LearningEvent but skips the mastered_concepts mutation entirely, so a
    correct diagnostic answer cannot pollute the profile with a fake "tested
    mastery" promotion.
