"""pgvector-backed embedding store. Replaces ChromaDB (Phase 7 T4).

Thin wrapper around the `chunk_embeddings` table so tests can monkeypatch
`insert_chunks` / `query_chunks` without standing up a real Postgres.

Cosine-distance search uses pgvector's `<=>` operator via the ORM's
`embedding.cosine_distance(...)` builder. On non-pgvector dialects (e.g.
SQLite in unit tests) the query is never executed because tests patch this
module.

    The search post-filters on `documents.status = 'ready'`, so an HNSW scan
    that returns exactly k candidates can yield fewer than k usable rows.
    `hnsw.ef_search` enlarges the per-scan candidate list, and pgvector 0.8's
    `hnsw.iterative_scan = strict_order` re-scans deeper until k rows survive
    the filter while preserving exact distance ordering (`relaxed_order` would
    return rows slightly out of order).

    Both are `SET LOCAL`, i.e. transaction-scoped, so they must be issued in
    the same transaction as the search, immediately before it. SET cannot take
    bind parameters, so `ef_search` goes through `set_config(name, value,
    is_local=true)` (the bind-safe equivalent of SET LOCAL); int() is the
    validation. The pair runs inside a SAVEPOINT: on a pgvector < 0.8 server
    `iterative_scan` is an unknown GUC and raises, which would otherwise abort
    the whole transaction and take the search down with it.

    The savepoint is taken at Core level (`db.connection().begin_nested()`)
    rather than via `Session.begin_nested()`, which unconditionally flushes
    pending ORM state regardless of autoflush. This session runs with
    autoflush=False by design, and retrieval is invoked mid-turn with
    profile/event rows potentially pending; forcing a flush here would
    surface an unrelated write error as a retrieval failure.
