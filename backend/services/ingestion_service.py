"""File ingestion background pipeline (Spec §4.2, §3.1).

run(document_id) is invoked by the worker process (services.worker) after it
claims a pending document from the queue. Opens its own SessionLocal because
no request-scoped DB session exists in the worker.

Pipeline:
  1. Load Document, capture its identifiers as plain locals, then close the
     session (F-02) so steps 2-3 hold no pooled DB connection. Load the blob
     via services.object_store (R2 in prod, local disk in dev), not
     settings.uploads_path directly. The Document is re-fetched by id before
     step 4; every failure arm re-fetches by id too, never touching the
     detached instance.
  2. _extract(blob, filename) -> [(page_num | None, text), ...] by extension.
     - .pdf  : pypdf -> [(page_num, text), ...]
     - .pptx : python-pptx -> [(slide_num, text), ...]
     - .txt / .md / .markdown : [(None, full_text)]
  3. lib.chunking.chunk_text (500 / 50 overlap), streaming with
     max_chunks=settings.max_chunks: an oversized document raises
     ChunkLimitExceeded mid-stream and is marked failed without the
     remaining pages ever being tokenised (F-03).
  4. _embed_and_store: per EMBED_BATCH slice (100 chunks) -- cap-check,
     embed (litellm.embedding), insert (pgvector_store.insert_chunks),
     meter (cost_meter.meter_embedding_response), commit. No DB transaction
     is held open during the litellm.embedding HTTP call (F-02/B-02), and
     nothing accumulates for the whole document in memory at once (F-03) --
     a batch's vectors and raw response are discarded as soon as that
     batch's commit lands.
  5. lib.keyword_index.merge_into_session(stems).
  6. Document.status = ready, page_count populated (None for plaintext).

Because embedding/insert/meter now commit per batch, a crash mid-document
leaves a prefix of chunks durably persisted with their spend already on the
ledger -- nothing to re-record on failure. Resume contract: _embed_and_store
looks up chunk_index values already persisted for the document
(_existing_chunk_indexes) and skips them before making any embedding call,
so re-running ingestion for a partially-ingested document never re-pays for
chunks it already bought and stored.

Steps 5-6 still share one transaction with the final batch's own commit
boundary: merge_into_session only flushes, and the closing db.commit() after
step 6 covers it (F-27 applies only to this tail, not to the already-durable
embedding batches). On exception at any step: db.rollback() first (discards
any unflushed/uncommitted work from this run -- committed batches are
unaffected), then status=failed and a fixed error string, committed alone.

C-11: `documents.error` is rendered verbatim by the frontend, so it never
carries exception text (which can embed server paths, blob keys, or provider
payloads). Every value this module writes is one of the constants collected
in INGEST_ERROR_MESSAGES, selected by the pipeline stage that failed; the
original exception goes to the log line only.
